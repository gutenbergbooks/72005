  PUNCTUATION

  Personified:

  OR

  POINTING MADE EASY.

  BY

  MR. STOPS.

  LONDON:

  JOHN HARRIS,
  CORNER OF ST. PAUL’S CHURCH-YARD.

  PRINTED BY S. AND R. BENTLEY, DORSET STREET.

ROBERT’S first interview with M^R. STOPS.


  Young Robert could read but he gabbled so fast:
  And ran on with such speed, that all meaning he lost.
  Till one Morning he met M^r. Stops by the way,
  Who advis’d him to listen to what he should say.
  Then entering the house, he a riddle repeated.
  To shew, WITHOUT STOPS, how the ear may be cheated.

M^R. STOPS READING TO ROBERT AND HIS SISTER.


      “Ev’ry lady in this land
      “Has twenty nails upon each hand
      “Five & twenty on hands & feet
      “And this is true without deceit.”
    But when the stops were plac’d aright,
    The real sense was brought to light.




[Illustration: Counsellor]




COUNSELLOR COMMA, marked thus ,


      Here counsellor Comma the reader may view,
      Who knows neither guile nor repentance;
      A straight forward path he resolves to pursue
      By dividing short parts of a sentence;
    As “Charles can sing, whistle, leap, tumble, & run,”—
    Yet so BRIEF is each pause, that he merely counts ONE.




[Illustration: Ensign with flag]




ENSIGN SEMICOLON, marked thus ;


    See, how Semicolon is strutting with pride;
    Into two or more parts he’ll a sentence divide.
    As “John’s a good scholar; but George is a better:
    One wrote a fair copy; the other a letter.”
      Without this gay ensign we little could do;
      And when he appears we must pause & count TWO.




[Illustration Colon on a stick]




A COLON, marked thus :


    The colon consists of two dots, as you see:
    And remains within sight whilst you count one, two, three:
    Tis us’d where the sense is complete, tho but part
    Of the sentence you’re reading, or learning by heart.
    As “Gold is deceitful: it bribes to destroy.”
    “Young James is admired: he’s a very good boy.”




[Illustration: Figure holding cloth]




A PERIOD OR FULL STOP,

_marked thus_ .


    The full-fac’d gentleman here shown
    To all my friends, no doubt, is known:
    In him the PERIOD we behold,
    Who stands his ground whilst four are told;
    And always ends a perfect sentence,
    As “Crime is followed by repentance.”




[Illustration: Crooked man]




THE INTERROGATIVE POINT ?


    What little crooked man is this?
    He’s call’d INTERROGATION, Miss:
    He’s always asking this & that,
    As “What’s your name? Whose dog is that?”
      And for your answer, he will stay
      While you, One, Two, Three, Four, can say.




[Illustration: Figure reading]




THE EXCLAMATION POINT !

or Note of Admiration.


    This Youth, so struck with admiration,
    Is of a wondering generation,
    With face so long, and thin and pale,
    He cries, “Oh! what a wonderous tale!”
    While you count four, he stops, and then,
    Admiring! he goes on again.




[Illustration: People on boat]


AN APOSTROPHE ’


    The comma, plac’d as here you see,
    From the word LOV’D has snatch’d a letter;
    It bears the name APOSTROPHE:—
    And, perhaps, you can’t contrive a better.
      In poetry ’tis chiefly found,
      Where sense should coincide with sound.




[Illustration: Figure holding Acute and Grave papers]




A DASH — CIRCUMFLEX ^ BREVE ˘ DIÆRESIS ¨ HYPHEN - ACUTE ACCENT ´ GRAVE
ACCENT ` PARENTHESIS ( )


    A DASH & a CIRCUMFLEX here form a hat;
    A BREVE serves to mark out the face;
    DIÆRESIS, too, & the HYPHEN come pat,
    As a breast & a neck in their place:
    The arms are the ACCENTS, both GRAVE & ACUTE,
    And for legs the PARENTHESIS nicely may suit.




[Illustration:

  YOU
  DON’T SEE

  The use of me.

  Don’t ^{you} see
  a Caret]




A CARET, marked thus ^ .


    If you a letter are inditing
    And make an error in your writing,
    By leaving out a word, or two,
    The CARET may be us’d by you;
    As “This ^{new} book to Charles I send,
    And hope to please ^{my} dearest friend.”




[Illustration: Section figure]




A SECTION, marked thus §.


    This Gentleman of deep reflections,
    Divides a subject into Sections;
    Ideas ranging under heads,
    As gardens are laid out in beds;
    That o’er the whole the eye may move,
    Survey the plan, & then approve.




[Illustration Chapter figure]




A PARAGRAPH ¶.


    The PARAGRAPH, which here you view,
    Always announces something new;
    Distinct from what was read before,
    As is the water from the shore.
      This mark in Scripture oft is found,
      As thriving best on sacred ground.




[Illustration: “Remember me” sign]




A QUOTATION “ ”


      Two commas standing on their heads,
        Their orders are obeying;
      Two others, risen from their beds,
        Their best respects are paying;
    These four are ushers of much use,
    As they great authors introduce.




[Illustration: Figures of punctuation]




BRACKETS OR CROTCHETS [] BRACE } ELLIPSIS __ PARALLELS ∥ OBELISK †
DOUBLE DAGGER ‡ ASTERISK *


    These BRACKETS some words may enclose, without doubt:
          The BRACE several lines will unite;
    ELLIPSIS is us’d where we letters leave out.
          As k—t may be read for a knight.
    The PARALLELS, OB’LISK, & DAGGERS we find,
    Like the ASTERISK only for ref’rence design’d.
